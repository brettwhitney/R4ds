#' ### Introduction to Explore Section
#' Data exploration means looking at data, quickly generate 
#' questions/hypotheses, test them, and repeat.
#' We want to generate many promising avenues for in-depth investigation.
#' 

library(tidyverse)

#' ### 3.2 First steps
#' Do cars with big engines use more fuel than cars with small engines?
#' Definitely a positive correlation between these two, 
#' I'm gonna guess the relationship is also fairly linear.
#' 

ggplot(data = mpg) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy))

#' Plot shows as engine size increases, the mpg of the car decreases, 
#' confirming that there is a positive relationship between a car's engine size 
#' and how much fuel it uses.
#' 
#' `ggplot()` creates an empty plot to which we add layers using functions like `geom_point()`. 
#' Each geom function takes a `mapping` parameter which maps variables to visual 
#' properties, like the x and y axis of a scatterplot. 
#' 
#' #### 3.2 Exercises
#' 
#' 1. Run `ggplot(data = mpg)`. What do you see?

ggplot(data = mpg)

#' Running this code yields a light gray box with just a touch of white 
#' padding around the edges.
#'     
#' 2. How many rows are in `mpg`? How many columns?
 
nrow(mpg)
ncol(mpg)

#' 234 rows and 11 columns.
#'     
#' 3. What does the `drv` variable describe? Read the help for `?mpg` to find out.

?mpg

#' `drv` describes if the vehicle is front, rear, or four wheel drive. 
#'     
#' 4. Make a scatterplot of `hwy` vs `cyl`.

ggplot(data = mpg) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = hwy, y = cyl))

#' 5. What happens if you make a scatterplot of `class` vs `drv`? Why is the plot not useful?

ggplot(data = mpg) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = class, y = drv))

#' This plot isn't useful because neither variable is continuous/numeric, 
#' they are both categorical.
#' 
#' ### 3.3 Aesthetic Mappings
#' An aesthetic is a visual property or element of the stuff in a plot. 
#' Value -> describe data; Level -> describe an aesthetics's settings
#' 
ggplot(data = mpg) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = class))

#' When you map a variable name like `class` to an aesthetic like `color` ggplot 
#' will assign a unique level of the aesthetic to each value of the variable. 
#' This is called scaling in ggplot2 parlance. 
#' 
#' ggplot won't stop you from doing things that aren't great ideas, 
#' but it might warn you!
#' 
#' Mapping `size` to a discrete/categorical variable like `class` doesn't make for 
#' interpretable charts.
ggplot(data = mpg) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, size = class))

#' Some more less than useful aesthetic mappings for `class`:
ggplot(data = mpg) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, alpha = class))

ggplot(data = mpg) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, shape = class))

#' Important note! Don't use `shape` with more than 6 levels, because ggplot2 sure won't.
#' 
#' `x` and `y` are themselves aesthetics.
#' 
#' Aesthetics can be set at particular levels, like making all the points in a 
#' scatterplot blue.
ggplot(data = mpg) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy), color = "blue")

#' Notice that the color aesthetic is no longer passed to `aes()` in this use case, 
#' because it isn't associated with a variable anymore.
#' 
#' #### 3.3 Exercises
#' 1. What's gone wrong with this code? Why are the points not blue?
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = "blue"))
#' This plot doesn't work out because the `color` argument has been set within 
#' `aes()`. I would gather that ggplot then took "blue" as a nameless variable 
#' where all values equaled "blue" so it assigned a color, in this case red, to 
#' every row where the value of this nameless variable was "blue".
#' 
#' 2. Which variables in `mpg` are categorical? Which variables are continuous? 
#' (Hint: type `?mpg` to read the documentation for the dataset). How can you see 
#' this information when you run `mpg`?
#' 
#' Categorical: `manufacturer`, `model`, `trans`, `drv`, `fl`, `class`
#' Continuous: `displ`, `cty`, `hwy`, `cyl` (maybe)
#' I can see arguments for both: `year`
#' 
#' If you run `mpg` you will see the first ten rows and columns of the tibble, 
#' and it prints the column type below each column name.
#' 
#' 3. Map a continuous variable to color, size, and shape. How do these aesthetics 
#' behave differently for categorical vs. continuous variables?
#' 
ggplot(data = mpg) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = cty))

#' Instead of assigning a level to each unique value of `cty`, `color` assigned 
#' each value to a range of blues where darker blues have lower values of `cty`.
#' 
ggplot(data = mpg) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, size = cty))

#' Smaller values of `cty` are mapped to smaller shapes.
#' 
#ggplot(data = mpg) +
#  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, shape = cty))

#' This results in an error and no plot, since it would be madness to assign a different 
#' shape to each unique value of `cty`.
#' 
#' 4. What happens if you map the same variable to multiple aesthetics?
#' 
ggplot(data = mpg) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = cty, size = cty))

#' This works just fine, creating a legend for each aesthetic. In practice, 
#' perhaps a bit redundant, but I could see a scenario where one **really** wants 
#' to draw attention to a certain feature of the data.
#' 
#' 5. What does the `stroke` aesthetic do? What shapes does it work with? 
#' (Hint: use `?geom_point`)
#' 
#' `stroke` modifies the width of a shape's border, so it only works with shapes that 
#' have a border. 
#' 
#' 6. What happens if you map an aesthetic to something other than a variable name, 
#' like `aes(colour = displ < 5)`? Note, youâ€™ll also need to specify `x` and `y`.
#' 
ggplot(data = mpg) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = displ < 5))

#' Ohoho, this acts as a shorthand way to identify points in the data where a 
#' condition is true or false, me likey. 
#' 
#' ### 3.4 Common problems
#' 
#' **No matter how much practice I get writing code, every day I will continue to write code that doesn't work.**
#' 
#' Google is your friend.
#' 
#' ### 3.5 Facets
#' 
#' Facets are a good way to include additional variables to a plot, especially 
#' categorical variables.
#' 
#' `facet_wrap()` for faceting by one discrete variable
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + 
  facet_wrap(~ class, nrow = 2)

#' `facet_grid()` for faceting by two variables
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + 
  facet_grid(drv ~ cyl)

#' replacing one of the variables in `facet_grid()` will only facet in rows or 
#' columns, depending on which side of the formula your remaining variable is.
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + 
  facet_grid(. ~ cyl)

#' #### 3.5 Exercises
#' 1. What happens if you facet on a continuous variable?
ggplot(data = mpg) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  facet_wrap(~ cty)
#' ggplot makes a valiant effort to make plots for each value of your faceted 
#' variable, but you end up with too many plots and not enough data in many of 
#' them to see anything.
#' 
#' 2.What do the empty cells in plot with facet_grid(drv ~ cyl) mean? How do 
#' they relate to this plot?
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = drv, y = cyl))

#' They correspond to combinations of `drv` and `cyl` with no data to show. 
#' In relation to the above plot, they represent the intersections of `x` and `y` 
#' with no point plotted in the chart.

#' 3.What plots does the following code make? What does `.` do?
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  facet_grid(drv ~ .)

ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  facet_grid(. ~ cyl)

#' The first makes 3 plots in 1 column where each row corresponds to a value of `drv`.
#' The second makes 4 plots in 1 row where each column corresponds to a value of `cyl`.
#' So, `.` causes a faceted plot with only 1 variable, but in 1 row or 1 column 
#' rather than several columns/rows like `facet_wrap()`.

#' 4.Take the first faceted plot in this section:
#' 
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + 
  facet_wrap(~ class, nrow = 2)
#' 
#' What are the advantages to using faceting instead of the color aesthetic? 
#' What are the disadvantages? How might the balance change if you had a larger dataset?
#' 
#' Faceting over color makes it a little easier to interrogate subsets of data, 
#' especially when there are more than a handful of levels to the categorical variable you use to facet.
#' 
#' 5.Read `?facet_wrap`. What does `nrow` do? What does `ncol` do? What other options 
#' control the layout of the individual panels? Why doesn't `facet_grid()` have 
#' `nrow` and `ncol` arguments?
#' 
#' `nrow` and `ncol` control the number of rows or columns that ggplot will 
#' generate faceted plots into. `facet_grid()` doesn't have this because it gets 
#' those values from the variables you use to facet. Other options for controlling 
#' the layout include `as.table`, `drop`, `switch`, and `drop`.
#' 
#' 6. When using `facet_grid()` you should usually put the variable with more unique 
#' levels in the columns. Why?
#' 
#' I'm not satisfied with this answer, but I suppose it makes the overall appearance 
#' of the plots more square, which is more pleasing to the eye. I'd wager it also puts
#' empty facets at the bottom-right which is handy since we read left to right, top to 
#' bottom.
