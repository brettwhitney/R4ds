#' ### Introduction to Explore Section
#' Data exploration means looking at data, quickly generate 
#' questions/hypotheses, test them, and repeat.
#' We want to generate many promising avenues for in-depth investigation.
#' 

library(tidyverse)

#' ### 3.2 First steps
#' Do cars with big engines use more fuel than cars with small engines?
#' Definitely a positive correlation between these two, 
#' I'm gonna guess the relationship is also fairly linear.
#' 

ggplot(data = mpg) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy))

#' Plot shows as engine size increases, the mpg of the car decreases, 
#' confirming that there is a positive relationship between a car's engine size 
#' and how much fuel it uses.
#' 
#' `ggplot()` creates an empty plot to which we add layers using functions like `geom_point()`. 
#' Each geom function takes a `mapping` parameter which maps variables to visual 
#' properties, like the x and y axis of a scatterplot. 
#' 
#' #### 3.2 Exercises
#' 
#' 1. Run `ggplot(data = mpg)`. What do you see?

ggplot(data = mpg)

#' Running this code yields a light gray box with just a touch of white 
#' padding around the edges.
#'     
#' 2. How many rows are in `mpg`? How many columns?
 
nrow(mpg)
ncol(mpg)

#' 234 rows and 11 columns.
#'     
#' 3. What does the `drv` variable describe? Read the help for `?mpg` to find out.

?mpg

#' `drv` describes if the vehicle is front, rear, or four wheel drive. 
#'     
#' 4. Make a scatterplot of `hwy` vs `cyl`.

ggplot(data = mpg) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = hwy, y = cyl))

#' 5. What happens if you make a scatterplot of `class` vs `drv`? Why is the plot not useful?

ggplot(data = mpg) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = class, y = drv))

#' This plot isn't useful because neither variable is continuous/numeric, 
#' they are both categorical.
#' 
#' ### 3.3 Aesthetic Mappings
#' An aesthetic is a visual property or element of the stuff in a plot. 
#' Value -> describe data; Level -> describe an aesthetics's settings
#' 
ggplot(data = mpg) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = class))

#' When you map a variable name like `class` to an aesthetic like `color` ggplot 
#' will assign a unique level of the aesthetic to each value of the variable. 
#' This is called scaling in ggplot2 parlance. 
#' 
#' ggplot won't stop you from doing things that aren't great ideas, 
#' but it might warn you!
#' 
#' Mapping `size` to a discrete/categorical variable like `class` doesn't make for 
#' interpretable charts.
ggplot(data = mpg) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, size = class))

#' Some more less than useful aesthetic mappings for `class`:
ggplot(data = mpg) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, alpha = class))

ggplot(data = mpg) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, shape = class))

#' Important note! Don't use `shape` with more than 6 levels, because ggplot2 sure won't.
#' 
#' `x` and `y` are themselves aesthetics.
#' 
#' Aesthetics can be set at particular levels, like making all the points in a 
#' scatterplot blue.
ggplot(data = mpg) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy), color = "blue")

#' Notice that the color aesthetic is no longer passed to `aes()` in this use case, 
#' because it isn't associated with a variable anymore.
#' 
#' #### 3.3 Exercises
#' 1. What's gone wrong with this code? Why are the points not blue?
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = "blue"))
#' This plot doesn't work out because the `color` argument has been set within 
#' `aes()`. I would gather that ggplot then took "blue" as a nameless variable 
#' where all values equaled "blue" so it assigned a color, in this case red, to 
#' every row where the value of this nameless variable was "blue".
#' 
#' 2. Which variables in `mpg` are categorical? Which variables are continuous? 
#' (Hint: type `?mpg` to read the documentation for the dataset). How can you see 
#' this information when you run `mpg`?
#' 
#' Categorical: `manufacturer`, `model`, `trans`, `drv`, `fl`, `class`
#' Continuous: `displ`, `cty`, `hwy`, `cyl` (maybe)
#' I can see arguments for both: `year`
#' 
#' If you run `mpg` you will see the first ten rows and columns of the tibble, 
#' and it prints the column type below each column name.
#' 
#' 3. Map a continuous variable to color, size, and shape. How do these aesthetics 
#' behave differently for categorical vs. continuous variables?
#' 
ggplot(data = mpg) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = cty))

#' Instead of assigning a level to each unique value of `cty`, `color` assigned 
#' each value to a range of blues where darker blues have lower values of `cty`.
#' 
ggplot(data = mpg) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, size = cty))

#' Smaller values of `cty` are mapped to smaller shapes.
#' 
#ggplot(data = mpg) +
#  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, shape = cty))

#' This results in an error and no plot, since it would be madness to assign a different 
#' shape to each unique value of `cty`.
#' 
#' 4. What happens if you map the same variable to multiple aesthetics?
#' 
ggplot(data = mpg) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = cty, size = cty))

#' This works just fine, creating a legend for each aesthetic. In practice, 
#' perhaps a bit redundant, but I could see a scenario where one **really** wants 
#' to draw attention to a certain feature of the data.
#' 
#' 5. What does the `stroke` aesthetic do? What shapes does it work with? 
#' (Hint: use `?geom_point`)
#' 
#' `stroke` modifies the width of a shape's border, so it only works with shapes that 
#' have a border. 
#' 
#' 6. What happens if you map an aesthetic to something other than a variable name, 
#' like `aes(colour = displ < 5)`? Note, youâ€™ll also need to specify `x` and `y`.
#' 
ggplot(data = mpg) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = displ < 5))

#' Ohoho, this acts as a shorthand way to identify points in the data where a 
#' condition is true or false, me likey. 
#' 
#' ### 3.4 Common problems
#' 
#' **No matter how much practice I get writing code, every day I will continue to write code that doesn't work.**
#' 
#' Google is your friend.
#' 
#' ### 3.5 Facets
#' 
#' Facets are a good way to include additional variables to a plot, especially 
#' categorical variables.
#' 
#' `facet_wrap()` for faceting by one discrete variable
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + 
  facet_wrap(~ class, nrow = 2)

#' `facet_grid()` for faceting by two variables
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + 
  facet_grid(drv ~ cyl)

#' replacing one of the variables in `facet_grid()` will only facet in rows or 
#' columns, depending on which side of the formula your remaining variable is.
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + 
  facet_grid(. ~ cyl)

#' #### 3.5 Exercises
#' 1. What happens if you facet on a continuous variable?
ggplot(data = mpg) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  facet_wrap(~ cty)
#' ggplot makes a valiant effort to make plots for each value of your faceted 
#' variable, but you end up with too many plots and not enough data in many of 
#' them to see anything.
#' 
#' 2.What do the empty cells in plot with facet_grid(drv ~ cyl) mean? How do 
#' they relate to this plot?
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = drv, y = cyl))

#' They correspond to combinations of `drv` and `cyl` with no data to show. 
#' In relation to the above plot, they represent the intersections of `x` and `y` 
#' with no point plotted in the chart.

#' 3.What plots does the following code make? What does `.` do?
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  facet_grid(drv ~ .)

ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  facet_grid(. ~ cyl)

#' The first makes 3 plots in 1 column where each row corresponds to a value of `drv`.
#' The second makes 4 plots in 1 row where each column corresponds to a value of `cyl`.
#' So, `.` causes a faceted plot with only 1 variable, but in 1 row or 1 column 
#' rather than several columns/rows like `facet_wrap()`.

#' 4.Take the first faceted plot in this section:
#' 
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + 
  facet_wrap(~ class, nrow = 2)
#' 
#' What are the advantages to using faceting instead of the color aesthetic? 
#' What are the disadvantages? How might the balance change if you had a larger dataset?
#' 
#' Faceting over color makes it a little easier to interrogate subsets of data, 
#' especially when there are more than a handful of levels to the categorical variable you use to facet.
#' 
#' 5.Read `?facet_wrap`. What does `nrow` do? What does `ncol` do? What other options 
#' control the layout of the individual panels? Why doesn't `facet_grid()` have 
#' `nrow` and `ncol` arguments?
#' 
#' `nrow` and `ncol` control the number of rows or columns that ggplot will 
#' generate faceted plots into. `facet_grid()` doesn't have this because it gets 
#' those values from the variables you use to facet. Other options for controlling 
#' the layout include `as.table`, `drop`, `switch`, and `drop`.
#' 
#' 6. When using `facet_grid()` you should usually put the variable with more unique 
#' levels in the columns. Why?
#' 
#' I'm not satisfied with this answer, but I suppose it makes the overall appearance 
#' of the plots more square, which is more pleasing to the eye. I'd wager it also puts
#' empty facets at the bottom-right which is handy since we read left to right, top to 
#' bottom.
#' 
#' ### 3.6 Geometric Objects
#' 
#' The different visual objects available to display data are called geoms.
#' 
#' Could map a variable to aesthetics like `linetype` in `geom_smooth()` to assign 
#' different levels of that aesthetic to different values of the variable.
#' 
#' You can add as many different geoms as you'd like to one plot. 
#' Visit [here](https://exts.ggplot2.tidyverse.org/gallery/) for a gallery of 
#' geoms in different packages.
#' 
#' For geoms like `geom_smooth()` that use a single visual object to represent 
#' several rows of data you can use the `group` aesthetic to create several 
#' objects. `group` does not add a legend or distinguishing features to the 
#' different objects it draws.
#' 
ggplot(data = mpg) +
  geom_smooth(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy))

ggplot(data = mpg) +
  geom_smooth(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, group = drv))

ggplot(data = mpg) +
  geom_smooth(
    mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = drv),
    show.legend = FALSE
  )

#' Adding different geoms to a single plot is as easy as...literally adding them with `+`. 

ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  geom_smooth(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy))

#' And now our code is no longer DRY, so instead we can set a 'default' global 
#' mapping for each geom by declaring it with `aes()` inside the initial call 
#' to `ggplot()`.
#' 
ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth()

#' Less repetitive code, same result.
#' 
#' Using an aesthetic mapping in a geom then they will apply to that layer only. 
#' So if we want to modify the previous graph to color the points by class, but 
#' keep a single trend line we can do:
#' 
ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(color = class)) + 
  geom_smooth()

#' This idea of local mappings extend to the data argument as well. Different 
#' geoms in the same graph can use different data sets!
#' 
ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(color = class)) + 
  geom_smooth(data = filter(mpg, class == "subcompact"), se = FALSE)

#' #### 3.6 Exercises
#' 1. What geom would you use to draw a line chart? A boxplot? A histogram? 
#' An area chart?
#' 
#' `geom_line()`, `geom_boxplot()`, `geom_histogram()`, `geom_area()`
#' 
#' 2.Run this code in your head and predict what the output will look like. Then, 
#' run the code in R and check your predictions.
#' 
#' Prediction: A scatterplot under several smoothed lines whose color matches 
#' to `drv`. The points of the scatterplot would also be mapped to a color by 
#' their `drv` value. There will be a legend, and not the gray areas around the 
#' smoothed lines showing standard error of the estimated line.
#' 
ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = drv)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(se = FALSE)

#' Nailed it.
#' 
#' 3. What does show.legend = FALSE do? What happens if you remove it? Why do you 
#' think I used it earlier in the chapter?
#' 
#' It prevents a legend for that layer from being generated. I'd assume it was 
#' used because it was shown in context with 2 other charts that didn't have 
#' legends so removing it made the visual appearance of the charts more visually 
#' pleasing and the legend couldn't distract from the point being made. 
#' 
#' 4. What does the `se` argument to `geom_smooth()` do?
#' 
#' `se` controls if a confidence interval will be displayed around the estimated 
#' line.
#' 
#' 5. Will these two graphs look different? Why/why not?
#' 
#' They will be the same, both have the same aesthetic mappings for each layer, 
#' but the first takes advantage of the ability to declare a global mapping in 
#' `ggplot()`.
#' 
ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth()

ggplot() + 
  geom_point(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + 
  geom_smooth(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy))
#' 
#' 6. Recreate the R code necessary to generate the following graphs.
#' 
#' I went left to right, top to bottom:
#' 
ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(color = 'blue', se = FALSE)

ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(mapping = aes(group = drv), color = "blue", se = FALSE)

ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = drv)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(se = FALSE)

ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(color = drv)) +
  geom_smooth(color = "blue", se = FALSE)

ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(color = drv)) +
  geom_smooth(mapping = aes(linetype = drv), color = "blue", se = FALSE)

#' Had to look up the answer for this last one, my crappy eyes couldn't tell 
#' what was going on.
#' 
ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + 
  geom_point(size = 4, colour = "white") + 
  geom_point(aes(colour = drv))

#' ### 3.7 Statistical Transformations
#' 
#' Switching gears to the `diamonds` data set and `geom_bar()`.
#' 
ggplot(data = diamonds) + 
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = cut))

#' So the thing to point out here is that the y-axis, `count` is not a variable 
#' in the `diamonds` data set, nor did we supply it to `geom_bar()` in the mapping.
#' So where did it come from? While geoms like `geom_point()` visualize the raw 
#' data, many geoms like `geom_bar()` will actually calculate new values to be 
#' plotted. These new values include stuff like counts, predictions from a model, 
#' summary statistics, etc.
#' 
#' In ggplot parlance, a **stat** is the mathematical calculation used to generate 
#' these new values. The default value of the `stat` argument for each geom 
#' tells you what transformation that geom performs to plot the data. These 
#' correspond to a family of stat functions that can also be used with `ggplot()`.
#' 
ggplot(data = diamonds) + 
  stat_count(mapping = aes(x = cut))

#' Usually don't need to worry about using a stat explicitly, but are three 
#' reasons you might:
#' 1. Change the default, for example when the dataset already has a `count` 
#' variable and you need a bar chart.
#' 
demo <- tribble(
  ~cut,         ~freq,
  "Fair",       1610,
  "Good",       4906,
  "Very Good",  12082,
  "Premium",    13791,
  "Ideal",      21551
)

ggplot(data = demo) +
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = cut, y = freq), stat = "identity")

#' 2. You want to change the default mapping between computed variables and their 
#' aesthetics. Creating a bar chart of proportions rather than counts for example.
#' 
ggplot(data = diamonds) + 
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = cut, y = stat(prop), group = 1))

#' 3. To draw attention, in your code, to the transformations taking place. 
#' For example `stat_summary()` can be used like so:
#'
ggplot(data = diamonds) + 
  stat_summary(
    mapping = aes(x = cut, y = depth),
    fun.min = min,
    fun.max = max,
    fun = median
  )

#' #### 3.7 Exercises
#' 
#' 1. What is the default geom associated with `stat_summary()`? How could you 
#' rewrite the previous plot to use that geom function instead of the stat 
#' function?
#' 
#' The default geom is `geom_pointrange()` so we can rewrite the previous plot as:
ggplot(data = diamonds, mapping = aes(x = cut, y = depth)) +
  geom_pointrange(stat = "summary",
                  fun.min = min,
                  fun.max = max,
                  fun = median)

#' 2. What does `geom_col()` do? How is it different to `geom_bar()`?
#' 
#' `geom_col()` is essentially the same as `geom_bar()`, but the default stat 
#' is `identity` so you need to already have a count-like variable in your data 
#' present and explicitly map it to an aesthetic.
#' 
#' 3. Most geoms and stats come in pairs that are almost always used in concert. 
#' Read through the documentation and make a list of all the pairs. 
#' What do they have in common?
#' 
#' Sorry, no not doing this at 1 in the morning. 
#' 
#' 4. What variables does stat_smooth() compute? What parameters control its 
#' behavior?
#' 
#' `stat_smooth` computes these variables: `y`, `ymin`, `ymax`, and `se`. 
#' Parameters like `method`, `formula`, `n`, `level`, and `se` can be used to control 
#' how these are computed and/or plotted. 
#' 
#' 5. In our proportion bar chart, we need to set group = 1. Why? In other words 
#' what is the problem with these two graphs?
#' 
ggplot(data = diamonds) + 
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = cut, y = after_stat(prop)))

ggplot(data = diamonds) + 
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = cut, fill = color, y = after_stat(prop)))

#' Each value of cut is being treated as it's own group so the proportion of 
#' rows for each cut all equal 1. 
#' 
#' ### 3.8 Position Adjustments
#' 
#' **If you map `fill` to a variable like `clarity` then the bars are auto-magically stacked!**
#' 
ggplot(data = diamonds) + 
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = cut, fill = clarity))

#' If you don't want that you can tweak the `position` argument to a couple 
#' different options.
#' 
#' 1. `identity` - makes all bars start at 0 on the y-axis so they cover each 
#' other unless you use an alpha value or set `fill = NA`.
#' 
ggplot(data = diamonds, mapping = aes(x = cut, fill = clarity)) + 
  geom_bar(alpha = 1/5, position = "identity")

ggplot(data = diamonds, mapping = aes(x = cut, colour = clarity)) + 
  geom_bar(fill = NA, position = "identity")
#' 
#' 2. `fill` stacks the levels but sets each stacked bar to the same height. 
#' Good for comparing across groups.
#' 
ggplot(data = diamonds) + 
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = cut, fill = clarity), position = "fill")

#' 3. `dodge` puts objects that would overlap directly beside each other. 
#' Kinda like a quick histogram for each category on the x-axis.
#' 
ggplot(data = diamonds) + 
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = cut, fill = clarity), position = "dodge")

#' Overplotting got you down? Too many points graphed on top of each other 
#' making it difficult to see the real picture? Try `position = jitter` in 
#' your next scatterplot!
#' 
#' Before:
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy))

#' After: 
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy), position = "jitter")

#' #### 3.8 Exercises
#'
#' 1. What is the problem with this plot? How could you improve it?
#' 
ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = cty, y = hwy)) + 
  geom_point()

#' Guessing that things are overplotted, easy enough to find out:
ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = cty, y = hwy)) + 
  geom_jitter()
#' Yup, overplotted due to rounding.
#' 
#' 2. What parameters to `geom_jitter()` control the amount of jittering?
#' 
#' `width` and `height` control the left-right and up-down jittering
#' 
#' 3. Compare and contrast `geom_jitter()` with `geom_count()`.
#' 
#' Jittering adds a little bit of random noise to each individual point while 
#' `geom_count()` determines the number of points in an area then maps that count 
#' to the point's area on the grid.
ggplot(mpg, aes(cty, hwy)) +
  geom_count()

#' 
#' 4. Whatâ€™s the default position adjustment for `geom_boxplot()`? Create a 
#' visualization of the mpg dataset that demonstrates it.
#' 
#' The default is `dodge2`.
#' 
#' ### 3.9 Coordinate Systems
#' 
#' Don't worry if you have a hard time with coord systems in ggplot, Hadley says 
#' they are the most complicated part.
#' 
#' `coord_flip()` swaps the x and y axes.
#' 
#' `coord_quickmap()` sets things up properly for basic plotting of spatial data.
nz <- map_data("nz")

ggplot(nz, aes(long, lat, group = group)) +
  geom_polygon(fill = "white", colour = "black")

ggplot(nz, aes(long, lat, group = group)) +
  geom_polygon(fill = "white", colour = "black") +
  coord_quickmap()

#' `coord_polar()` uses polar coordinates, which I really should review from my 
#' high school math days.

bar <- ggplot(data = diamonds) + 
  geom_bar(
    mapping = aes(x = cut, fill = cut), 
    show.legend = FALSE,
    width = 1
  ) + 
  theme(aspect.ratio = 1) +
  labs(x = NULL, y = NULL)

bar + coord_flip()
bar + coord_polar()

#' #### 3.9 Exercises
#' 
#' 1. Turn a stacked bar chart into a pie chart using` coord_polar()`.
#' I got close here, never would've figured out `theta = "y"` nonsense without 
#' solutions repo.
ggplot(data = mpg) +
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = factor(1), fill = class), width = 1) +
  coord_polar(theta = "y")

#' 2. What does `labs()` do? Read the documentation.
#' This function gives you control over titles, subtitles, captions, tags, axis 
#' labels, etc. 
#' 
#' 3. Whatâ€™s the difference between `coord_quickmap()` and `coord_map()`?
#' `coord_map()` will use a projection (mercator for example) and is much more 
#' intensive a computation. It does not preserve straight lines. quickmap will 
#' preserve straight lines and is much faster. 
#' 
#' 4. What does the plot below tell you about the relationship between city and 
#' highway mpg? Why is `coord_fixed()` important? What does `geom_abline()` do?
ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = cty, y = hwy)) +
  geom_point() + 
  geom_abline() +
  coord_fixed()

#' `coord_fixed()` makes the scale between the x and y axis better for comparison, 
#' without it the relationship looks much flatter. `geom_abline()` adds the line 
#' `y = x` to the plot, which is handy for comparison.

#' ### 3.10 The layered grammar of graphics
#' 
#' We could abstract all these different layers into a template like this: 
# ggplot(data = <DATA>) + 
#   <GEOM_FUNCTION>(
#     mapping = aes(<MAPPINGS>),
#     stat = <STAT>, 
#     position = <POSITION>
#   ) +
#   <COORDINATE_FUNCTION> +
#   <FACET_FUNCTION>
#' 
#' This template has 7 parameters, which correspond to all the elements of the 
#' **grammar of graphics**. These are the 7 things you need to uniquely describe 
#' any plot.
