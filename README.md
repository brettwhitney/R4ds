# R4ds
This repository is where I keep code I write while working through Hadley Wickham's book, [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/).

I have a personal goal to spend 4 hours a week with this book to start out 2021. If you have somehow stumbled upon this repo, I hope you find something useful!
