# R4ds
This repository is where I keep code I write while working through Hadley Wickham's book, [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/). I followed the excellent guidance laid out by Jenny Bryan in the wonderful [Happy Git with R](https://happygitwithr.com/) resource, so several of the early commits to this repository are results of trying out various sections from there, rather than R4ds. 

I have a personal goal to spend 4 hours a week with this book to start out 2021. If you have somehow stumbled upon this repo, I hope you find something useful! At the moment my plan is work through the book on Mondays and Thursdays for 2 hours each night. I'm going to update this README with my current progress after each study session to aid my own accountability. 

9/4 (and sorta 9/5 depending on your timezone): Verified git and R Studio were playing nice, initialized this repository, learned about rendering R scripts as .md reports :exploding_head:, and read the general introduction to the book.
