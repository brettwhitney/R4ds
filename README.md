# R4ds
This repository is where I keep code I write while working through Hadley Wickham's book, [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/). I followed the excellent guidance laid out by Jenny Bryan in the wonderful [Happy Git with R](https://happygitwithr.com/) resource, so several of the early commits to this repository are results of trying out various sections from there, rather than R4ds. 

I have a personal goal to spend 4 hours a week with this book to start out 2021. If you have somehow stumbled upon this repo, I hope you find something useful! At the moment my plan is work through the book on Mondays and Wednesdays for 2 hours twice a week, but we'll see how well those days of the week pan out. I'm going to update this README with my current progress after each study session to aid my own accountability. 

**8 January**: Got through the exercises for section 3.2. To see my current work check out the `explore` branch of this repo.

**4 January**: Verified git and R Studio were playing nice, initialized this repository, learned about rendering R scripts as .md reports :exploding_head:, and read the general introduction to the book.
